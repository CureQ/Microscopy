Colocalization Analysis GUI for mHTT and CCT1

This is a Python-based GUI to analyze colocalization between mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates and the CCT1 chaperone in 3D fluorescence microscopy images.

The GUI is designed for biomedical researchers at the Prinses Máxima Centrum and collaborating institutions, and is described in the thesis “Colocalization patterns of mutant Huntingtin and the CTT1 chaperone”.

It enables fully reproducible, semi-automated analysis without the need for coding.

Features
	•	Load multi-channel, z-stacked fluorescence microscopy images (.lif, .tiff)
	•	Perform classical segmentation of mHTT aggregates (Otsu thresholding)
	•	Quantify CCT1 enrichment in mHTT aggregates (intensity-based analysis)
	•	Compute colocalization metrics:
	•	Pearson’s r
	•	Manders M1 / M2
	•	Dice Similarity Coefficient
	•	Intersection over Union (IoU)
	•	Mann-Whitney U test
	•	Cohen’s d (effect size)
	•	Save quantitative results (CSV) and visualization overlays (PDF, images)
	•	Optional: visualize 3D overlay
	•	User-friendly GUI with step-by-step flow

Usage Guide

1. Load Image
	•	Supported formats: .tiff, .lif
	•	Load a multi-channel z-stacked image.

2. Select Channels
	•	Select channels for:
	•	mHTT (typically Red)
	•	CCT1 (typically Green)
	•	Optional: nucleus, other channels
	•	Scroll through z-slices to inspect.
	•	Click Accept to continue.

3. Hyperparameters & Segmentation
	•	Adjust parameters if needed:
	•	e.g. Otsu threshold tuning for mHTT.
	•	Enable / disable Cellpose segmentation (optional).

4. Run Analysis
	•	Click Run Colocalization.
	•	The pipeline will:
	•	Segment mHTT aggregates (threshold-based).
	•	Compute enrichment of CCT1 signal in mHTT regions.
	•	Compute structural colocalization metrics.

5. Save Results
	•	Select output folder.
	•	Outputs:
	•	CSV of all computed metrics.
	•	PDF report with visual overlays.
	•	Optional 3D visualization.

⸻

Limitations
	•	Batch processing not supported (single-image analysis only).
	•	CCT1 channel is analyzed using intensity enrichment; no object segmentation is performed for CCT1.
	•	Human-in-the-loop is required:
	•	Users must inspect visual overlays before trusting numerical outputs.
	•	Designed for research-use only, not for clinical decision making.
